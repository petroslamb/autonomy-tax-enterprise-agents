# Executive summary 

This document recommends guidelines for providers  of any systems that use artificial intelligence (AI), 

whether those systems have been created from scratch or built on top of tools and services provided by 

others. Implementing these guidelines will help providers build AI systems that function as intended, are 

available when needed, and work without revealing sensitive data to unauthorised parties. 

This document is aimed primarily at providers of AI systems who are using models hosted by an 

organisation, or are using external application programming interfaces (APIs). We urge  all  stakeholders 

(including data scientists, developers, managers, decision-makers and risk owners) to read these guidelines 

to help them make informed decisions about the  design , development , deployment  and  operation  of their 

AI systems. 

# About the guidelines 

AI systems have the potential to bring many benefits to society. However, for the opportunities of AI to be 

fully realised, it must be developed, deployed and operated in a secure and responsible way. 

AI systems are subject to novel security vulnerabilities that need to be considered alongside standard 

cyber security threats. When the pace of development is high – as is the case with AI – security can often 

be a secondary consideration. Security must be a core requirement, not just in the development phase, but 

throughout the life cycle of the system. 

For this reason, the guidelines are broken down into four key areas within the AI system development life 

cycle:  secure design , secure development , secure deployment , and  secure operation and maintenance .

For each section we suggest considerations and mitigations that will help reduce the overall risk to an 

organisational AI system development process. 

1.  Secure design 

This section contains guidelines that apply to the design stage of the AI system development life cycle. It 

covers understanding risks and threat modelling, as well as specific topics and trade-offs to consider on 

system and model design. 

2.  Secure development 

This section contains guidelines that apply to the development stage of the AI system development life 

cycle, including supply chain security, documentation, and asset and technical debt management. 

3.  Secure deployment 

This section contains guidelines that apply to the deployment stage of the AI system development 

life cycle, including protecting infrastructure and models from compromise, threat or loss, developing 

incident management processes, and responsible release. 

4.  Secure operation and maintenance 

This section contains guidelines that apply to the secure operation and maintenance stage of the AI 

system development life cycle. It provides guidelines on actions particularly relevant once a system has 

been deployed, including logging and monitoring, update management and information sharing. 

The guidelines follow a ‘secure by default’ approach, and are aligned closely to practices defined in the 

NCSC’s  Secure development and deployment guidance , NIST’s  Secure Software Development Framework ,

and ‘ secure by design principles ’ published by CISA, the NCSC and international cyber agencies. They 

prioritise: 

> taking ownership of security outcomes for customers 

> embracing radical transparency and accountability 

> building organisational structure and leadership so secure by design is a top business priority Introduction 

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to bring many benefits to society. However, for the 

opportunities of AI to be fully realised, it must be developed, deployed and operated in a secure and 

responsible way. Cyber security is a necessary precondition for the safety, resilience, privacy, fairness, 

efficacy and reliability of AI systems. 

However, AI systems are subject to novel security vulnerabilities that need to be considered alongside 

standard cyber security threats. When the pace of development is high – as is the case with AI – security 

can often be a secondary consideration. Security must be a core requirement, not just in the development 

phase, but throughout the life cycle of the system. 

This document recommends guidelines for providers 1 of any systems that use AI, whether those 

systems have been created from scratch or built on top of tools and services provided by others. 

Implementing these guidelines will help providers build AI systems that function as intended, are 

available when needed, and work without revealing sensitive data to unauthorised parties. 

These guidelines should be considered in conjunction with established cyber security, risk management, 

and incident response best practice. In particular, we urge providers to follow the ‘secure by design’ 2

principles developed by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the UK National 

Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and all our international partners. The principles prioritise: 

> taking ownership of security outcomes for customers 

> embracing radical transparency and accountability 

> building organisational structure and leadership so secure by design is a top business priority. 

Following ‘secure by design’ principles requires significant resources throughout a system’s life cycle. It 

means developers must invest in prioritising  features , mechanisms , and  implementation  of tools that 

protect customers at each layer of the system design, and across all stages of the development life cycle. 

Doing this will prevent costly redesigns later, as well as safeguarding customers and their data in the near 

term. 

# Why is AI security different? 

In this document we use ‘AI’ to refer specifically to machine learning (ML) applications 3. All types of ML are in 

scope. We define ML applications as applications that: 

> involve software components (models) that allow computers to recognise and bring context to patterns 

in data without the rules having to be explicitly programmed by a human 

> generate predictions, recommendations, or decisions based on statistical reasoning 

As well as existing cyber security threats, AI systems are subject to new types of vulnerabilities. The term 

‘adversarial machine learning’ (AML), is used to describe the exploitation of fundamental vulnerabilities in ML 

components, including hardware, software, workflows and supply chains. AML enables attackers to cause 

unintended behaviours in ML systems which can include: 

> affecting the model’s classification or regression performance 

> allowing users to perform unauthorised actions 

> extracting sensitive model information 

There are many ways to achieve these effects, such as prompt injection attacks in the large language 

model (LLM) domain, or deliberately corrupting the training data or user feedback (known as ‘data 

poisoning’).

# Who should read this document? 

This document is aimed primarily at providers of AI systems, whether based on models hosted by an 

organisation or making use of external application programming interfaces (APIs). However, we urge  all 

stakeholders (including data scientists, developers, managers, decision-makers and risk owners) to read 

these guidelines to help them make informed decisions about the  design , deployment  and  operation  of 

their machine learning AI systems. 

That said, not all of the guidelines will be directly applicable to all organisations. The level of sophistication 

and the methods of attack will vary depending on the adversary targeting the AI system, so the guidelines 

should be considered alongside your organisation’s use cases and threat profile. 

# Who is responsible for developing secure AI? 

There are often many actors in modern AI supply chains. A simple approach assumes two entities: 

> the ‘provider’ who is responsible for data curation, algorithmic development, design, deployment and 

maintenance 

> the ‘user’, who provides inputs and receives outputs 

While this provider-user approach is used in many applications, it is becoming increasingly uncommon, as 

providers may look to incorporate software, data, models and/or remote services provided by third parties 

into their own systems. These complex supply chains make it harder for end users to understand where 

responsibility for secure AI lies. 

Users (whether ‘end users’, or providers incorporating an external AI component) do not typically have 

sufficient visibility and/or expertise to fully understand, evaluate or address risks associated with systems 

they are using. As such, in line with ‘secure by design’ principles,  providers of AI components should take 

responsibility for the security outcomes of users further down the supply chain. 

Providers should implement security controls and mitigations where possible within their models, pipelines 

and/or systems, and where settings are used, implement the most secure option as default. Where risks 

cannot be mitigated, the provider should be responsible for: 

> informing users further down the supply chain of the risks that they and (if applicable) their own users 

are accepting 

> advising them on how to use the component securely 

Where system compromise could lead to tangible or widespread physical or reputational damage, 

significant loss of business operations, leakage of sensitive or confidential information and/or legal 

implications, AI cyber security risks should be treated as  critical .Guidelines for secure AI system development 

The guidelines are broken down into four key areas within the AI system development life cycle:  secure 

design , secure development , secure deployment , and  secure operation and maintenance . For each area, 

we suggest considerations and mitigations that will help reduce the overall risk to the organisational AI 

system development process. 

The guidelines set out in this document are aligned closely to software development life cycle practices 

defined in: 

> the NCSC’s  Secure development and deployment guidance 

> the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  Secure Software Development Framework 

(SSDF) 6

Guidelines for secure AI system development This section contains guidelines that apply to the  design  stage of the AI system development life cycle. It 

covers understanding risks and threat modelling, as well as specific topics and trade-offs to consider on 

system and model design. 

Raise staff awareness of threats and risks 

System owners and senior leaders understand threats to secure AI and their mitigations. Your data 

scientists and developers maintain an awareness of relevant security threats and failure modes and 

help risk owners to make informed decisions. You provide users with guidance on the unique security 

risks facing AI systems (for example, as part of standard InfoSec training) and train developers in secure 

coding techniques and secure and responsible AI practices. 

# 1. Secure design 

> 09

Design your system for security as well as functionality and performance 

You are confident that the task at hand is most appropriately addressed using AI. Having determined 

this, you assess the appropriateness of your AI-specific design choices. You consider your threat model 

and associated security mitigations alongside functionality, user experience, deployment environment, 

performance, assurance, oversight, ethical and legal requirements, among other considerations. 

For example: 

> you consider supply chain security when choosing whether to develop in house or use external 

components, for example: 

> your choice to train a new model, use an existing model (with or without fine-tuning) or 

access a model via an external API is appropriate to your requirements 

> your choice to work with an external model provider includes a due diligence evaluation of 

that provider’s own security posture 

> if using an external library, you complete a due diligence evaluation (for example, to 

ensure the library has controls that prevent the system loading untrusted models without 

immediately exposing themselves to arbitrary code execution 9)

> you implement scanning and isolation/sandboxing when importing third-party models or 

serialised weights, which should be treated as untrusted third-party code and could enable 

remote code execution 

Model the threats to your system 

As part of your risk management process, you apply a holistic process to assess the threats to your 

system, which includes understanding the potential impacts to the system, users, organisations, and 

wider society if an AI component is compromised or behaves unexpectedly 7. This process involves 

assessing the impact of AI-specific threats 8 and documenting your decision making. 

You recognise that the sensitivity and types of data used in your system may influence its value as a 

target to an attacker. Your assessment should consider that some threats may grow as AI systems 

increasingly become viewed as high value targets, and as AI itself enables new, automated attack 

vectors. 

> Guidelines for secure AI system development

> if using an external API, you apply appropriate controls to data that can be sent to services 

outside of your organisation’s control, such as requiring users to log in and confirm before 

sending potentially sensitive information 

> you apply appropriate checks and sanitisation of data and inputs; this includes when 

incorporating user feedback or continuous learning data into your model, recognising that 

training data defines system behaviour 

> you integrate AI software system development into existing secure development and operations 

best practices; all elements of the AI system are written in appropriate environments using coding 

practices and languages that reduce or eliminate known classes of vulnerabilities where plausible 

> if AI components need to trigger actions, for example amending files or directing output to external 

systems, you apply appropriate restrictions to the possible actions (this includes external AI and non-

AI fail-safes if necessary) 

> decisions around user interaction are informed by AI-specific risks, for example: 

> your system provides users with usable outputs without revealing unnecessary levels of 

detail to a potential attacker 

> if necessary, your system provides effective guardrails around model outputs 

> if offering an API to external customers or collaborators, you apply appropriate controls that 

mitigate attacks on the AI system via the API 

> you integrate the most secure settings into the system by default 

> you apply least privilege principles to limit access to a system’s functionality 

> you explain riskier capabilities to users and require users to opt in to use them; you 

communicate prohibited use cases, and, where possible, inform users of alternative 

solutions 

> 10

Consider security benefits and trade-offs when selecting your AI model 

Your choice of AI model will involve balancing a range of requirements. This includes choice of model 

architecture, configuration, training data, training algorithm and hyperparameters. Your decisions are 

informed by your threat model, and are regularly reassessed as AI security research advances and 

understanding of the threat evolves. 

When choosing an AI model, your considerations will likely include, but are not limited to: 

> the complexity of the model you are using, that is, the chosen architecture and number of parameters; 

your model’s chosen architecture and number of parameters will, among other factors, affect how 

much training data it requires and how robust it is to changes in input data when in use 

> the appropriateness of the model for your use case and/or feasibility of adapting it to your specific 

need (for example by fine-tuning) 

> the ability to align, interpret and explain your model’s outputs (for example for debugging, audit or 

regulatory compliance); there may be benefits to using simpler, more transparent models over large 

and complex ones which are more difficult to interpret 

> characteristics of training dataset(s), including size, integrity, quality, sensitivity, age, relevance and 

diversity 

> Guidelines for secure AI system development

> the value of using model hardening (such as adversarial training), regularisation and/or privacy-

enhancing techniques 

> the provenance and supply chains of components including the model or foundation model, training 

data and associated tools

‘Principles for the Security of Machine Learning’, in particular  Design for security (model architecture) .

> 11
> Guidelines for secure AI system development

This section contains guidelines that apply to the  development  stage of the AI system development 

lifecycle, including supply chain security, documentation, and asset and technical debt management. 

Secure your supply chain 

You assess and monitor the security of your AI supply chains across a system’s life cycle, and require 

suppliers to adhere to the same standards your own organisation applies to other software. If 

suppliers cannot adhere to your organisation’s standards, you act in accordance with your existing risk 

management policies. 

Where not produced in-house, you acquire and maintain well-secured and well-documented hardware 

and software components (for example, models, data, software libraries, modules, middleware, 

frameworks, and external APIs) from verified commercial, open source, and other third-party developers to 

ensure robust security in your systems. 

You are ready to failover to alternate solutions for mission-critical systems, if security criteria are not met. 

You use resources like the NCSC’s  Supply Chain Guidance  and frameworks such as Supply Chain Levels 

for Software Artifacts (SLSA) 10  for tracking attestations of the supply chain and software development life 

cycles. 

Identify, track and protect your assets 

You understand the value to your organisation of your AI-related assets, including models, data 

(including user feedback), prompts, software, documentation, logs and assessments (including 

information about potentially unsafe capabilities and failure modes), recognising where they represent 

significant investment and where access to them enables an attacker. You treat logs as sensitive data 

and implement controls to protect their confidentiality, integrity and availability. 

You know where your assets reside and have assessed and accepted any associated risks. You have 

processes and tools to track, authenticate, version control and secure your assets, and can restore to a 

known good state in the event of compromise. 

You have processes and controls in place to manage what data AI systems can access, and to manage 

content generated by AI according to its sensitivity (and the sensitivity of the inputs that went into 

generating it). 

Document your data, models and prompts 

You document the creation, operation, and life cycle management of any models, datasets and meta-

or system-prompts. Your documentation includes security-relevant information such as the sources 

of training data (including fine-tuning data and human or other operational feedback), intended 

scope and limitations, guardrails, cryptographic hashes or signatures, retention time, suggested review 

frequency and potential failure modes. Useful structures to help do this include model cards, data cards 

and software bills of materials (SBOMs). The production of comprehensive documentation supports 

transparency and accountability 11 .

# 2. Secure development 

> Guidelines for secure AI system development

Manage your technical debt 

As with any software system, you identify, track and manage your ‘technical debt’ throughout an AI 

system’s life cycle (technical debt is where engineering decisions that fall short of best practices to 

achieve short-term results are made, at the expense of longer-term benefits). Like financial debt, 

technical debt is not inherently bad, but should be managed from the earliest stages of development 12 .

You recognise that doing so can be more challenging in an AI context than for standard software, and 

that your levels of technical debt are likely to be high due to rapid development cycles and a lack of 

well-established protocols and interfaces. You ensure your life cycle plans (including processes to 

decommission AI systems) assess, acknowledge and mitigate risks to future similar systems. 

> 13
> Guidelines for secure AI system development 14

This section contains guidelines that apply to the  deployment  stage of the AI system development life 

cycle, including protecting infrastructure and models from compromise, threat or loss, developing incident 

management processes, and responsible release. 

Secure your infrastructure 

You apply good infrastructure security principles to the infrastructure used in every part of your system’s 

life cycle. You apply appropriate access controls to your APIs, models and data, and to their training and 

processing pipelines, in research and development as well as deployment. This includes appropriate 

segregation of environments holding sensitive code or data. This will also help mitigate standard cyber 

security attacks which aim to steal a model or harm its performance. 

Protect your model continuously 

Attackers may be able to reconstruct the functionality of a model 13  or the data it was trained on 14 , by 

accessing a model directly (by acquiring model weights) or indirectly (by querying the model via an 

application or service). Attackers may also tamper with models, data or prompts during or after training, 

rendering the output untrustworthy. 

You protect the model and data from direct and indirect access, respectively, by: 

> implementing standard cyber security best practices 

> implementing controls on the query interface to detect and prevent attempts to access, modify, and 

exfiltrate confidential information 

To ensure that consuming systems can validate models, you compute and share cryptographic hashes 

and/or signatures of model files (for example, model weights) and datasets (including checkpoints) as 

soon as the model is trained. As always with cryptography, good key management is essential 15 .

Your approach to confidentiality risk mitigation will depend considerably on the use case and the threat 

model. Some applications, for example those involving very sensitive data, may require theoretical 

guarantees that can be difficult or expensive to apply. If appropriate, privacy-enhancing technologies 

(such as differential privacy or homomorphic encryption) can be used to explore or assure levels of risk 

associated with consumers, users and attackers having access to models and outputs. 

# 3. Secure deployment 

> Guidelines for secure AI system development

Develop incident management procedures 

The inevitability of security incidents affecting your AI systems is reflected in your incident response, 

escalation and remediation plans. Your plans reflect different scenarios and are regularly reassessed as 

the system and wider research evolves. You store critical company digital resources in offline backups. 

Responders have been trained to assess and address AI-related incidents. You provide high-quality audit 

logs and other security features or information to customers and users at no extra charge, to enable their 

incident response processes. Release AI responsibly 

You release models, applications or systems only after subjecting them to appropriate and effective 

security evaluation such as benchmarking and red teaming (as well as other tests that are out of scope 

for these guidelines, such as safety or fairness), and you are clear to your users about known limitations 

or potential failure modes. Details of open-source security testing libraries are given in the  further reading 

section  at the end of this document. 

Make it easy for users to do the right things 

You recognise that each new setting or configuration option is to be assessed in conjunction with the 

business benefit it derives, and any security risks it introduces. Ideally, the most secure setting will be 

integrated into the system as the only option. When configuration is necessary, the default option should 

be broadly secure against common threats (that is, secure by default). You apply controls to prevent the 

use or deployment of your system in malicious ways. 

You provide users with guidance on the appropriate use of your model or system, which includes 

highlighting limitations and potential failure modes. You state clearly to users which aspects of security 

they are responsible for, and are transparent about where (and how) their data might be used, accessed 

or stored (for example, if it is used for model retraining, or reviewed by employees or partners). 

> 15
> Guidelines for secure AI system development

This section contains guidelines that apply to the  secure operation and maintenance  stage of the AI 

system development life cycle. It provides guidelines on actions particularly relevant once a system has 

been deployed, including logging and monitoring, update management and information sharing. 

Monitor your system’s behaviour 

You measure the outputs and performance of your model and system such that you can observe 

sudden and gradual changes in behaviour affecting security. You can account for and identify potential 

intrusions and compromises, as well as natural data drift. 

Monitor your system’s inputs 

In line with privacy and data protection requirements, you monitor and log inputs to your system (such 

as inference requests, queries or prompts) to enable compliance obligations, audit, investigation and 

remediation in the case of compromise or misuse. This could include explicit detection of out-of-

distribution and/or adversarial inputs, including those that aim to exploit data preparation steps (such as 

cropping and resizing for images). 

Follow a secure by design approach to updates 

You include automated updates by default in every product and use secure, modular update procedures 

to distribute them. Your update processes (including testing and evaluation regimes) reflect the fact that 

changes to data, models or prompts can lead to changes in system behaviour (for example, you treat 

major updates like new versions). You support users to evaluate and respond to model changes (for 

example by providing preview access and versioned APIs). 

Collect and share lessons learned 

You participate in information-sharing communities, collaborating across the global ecosystem of 

industry, academia and governments to share best practice as appropriate. You maintain open lines 

of communication for feedback regarding system security, both internally and externally to your 

organisation, including providing consent to security researchers to research and report vulnerabilities. 

When needed, you escalate issues to the wider community, for example publishing bulletins responding 

to vulnerability disclosures, including detailed and complete common vulnerability enumeration. You 

take action to mitigate and remediate issues quickly and appropriately.
